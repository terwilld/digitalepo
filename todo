#   Add file processing in stream.  Do not write to disk.  No need to read, process, write and send back.


#   Better Logging

#   Something other than just downloading to browser

#   workers for processing

#   Progress status for as file is being analyzed and processed

#   Separation of data and logic.  Files are STILL being written to the file system
#   At a minimum, log files to AWS
#   

#   There really is no reason to log files to the file system.  Can this all be done in memory, passing variables from one to another.
#   This currently will consume main thread read write.

#   How can a database be added for this.  There is no real logging required.





##   Lessons.

    Global variables are very not good.  This was a nightmarae of scope declaration accidentally creating millions of circular links in my objects.
    
    parsing of the json is the most expensive part.

    There can only be one next =D

##  Cool things:
     File Processing
     Monster function is pretty nifty recursive searching and reconstruction
     Error checking in the parse
     multi threading
